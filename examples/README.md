# Examples

This folder will contain small scripts and flowgraphs that I use while
learning SDR and HackRF One.

At the moment there is:

- `plot_spectrum.py` – simple Python script that loads a complex64 IQ
  recording and shows its power spectrum using NumPy and Matplotlib.

Later I plan to add:

- Scripts for demodulating FM broadcast and plotting audio waveform.
- Example GNU Radio Companion flowgraphs for FM, ADS-B and satellites.
