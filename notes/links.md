# Useful Links for SDR & Satellite Learning

Some of the resources I use (and plan to use) to learn SDR, HackRF, and
satellite reception.

## HackRF Documentation

- HackRF official product page (Great Scott Gadgets)  
  https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/
  
- HackRF detailed documentation on ReadTheDocs  
  https://hackrf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/   

## HackRF Hardware & Building

- HackRF official hardware designs (schematics, PCB files, etc.)  
  https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/hackrf/tree/master/hardware/hackrf-one  

- HackRF One hardware documentation (block diagrams, components, revisions)  
  https://hackrf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hackrf_one.html

## GNU Radio

These links are part of my study plan. As I make progress, I will add
more notes, summaries, and my own experiments to this repository.
