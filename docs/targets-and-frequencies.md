# Planned Targets and Frequencies

These are the main signals I plan to work with (all legal to receive):

## FM Broadcast

- ~88–108 MHz
- Used for basic SDR practice: tuning, filtering, demodulation.

## ADS-B (Aircraft)

- 1090 MHz
- Mode-S / ADS-B messages from aircraft.
- Goal: decode messages and show aircraft positions.

## Weather Satellites (NOAA APT)

- NOAA-15, 18, 19 around 137 MHz
- Analog APT images.
- Goal: receive at least one pass and decode an image of the Earth.

## Meteor-M2 (if possible)

- ~137.1 MHz
- Digital LRPT images (more advanced).
- Goal: attempt reception and document results, even partial.

## Amateur Satellites (examples, may change)

- Various frequencies in VHF/UHF amateur bands.
- Goal: listen to beacons and simple telemetry where allowed.
