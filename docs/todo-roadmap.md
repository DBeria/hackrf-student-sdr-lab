# TODO & Roadmap

This is my checklist for the project. I will update it as I go.

## Setup

- [x] Create public GitHub repo
- [x] Add README, license and initial docs
- [ ] Install GNU Radio / GQRX / SDRangel on my main laptop
- [ ] Test with free online IQ recordings

## First Experiments (no HackRF yet)

- [ ] Use GQRX or SDR# to demodulate FM broadcast from a cheap SDR or recordings
- [ ] Use `plot_spectrum.py` on an example IQ file
- [ ] Write down simple notes about what I see in the spectrum

## With HackRF One (once I have it)

- [ ] Verify HackRF is detected by the system
- [ ] Receive local FM broadcast with HackRF
- [ ] Record my own IQ file and plot its spectrum
- [ ] Try first ADS-B reception and decode aircraft positions

## Satellites

- [ ] Study NOAA satellite pass predictions
- [ ] Build or buy a simple V-dipole / QFH antenna
- [ ] Record at least one NOAA pass
- [ ] Try to decode a weather image and save it in this repo

## Sharing & Education

- [ ] Write at least one detailed tutorial in `docs/`
- [ ] Add screenshots of real signals
- [ ] Run a small session for local students (even just friends)
- [ ] Update docs with feedback and lessons learned
