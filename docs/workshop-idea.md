# Workshop Idea – "Invisible Signals Around Us"

Goal: a simple 2–3 hour session for students using HackRF One.

## Outline

1. **Introduction (30 min)**
   - What is SDR?
   - What is HackRF One?
   - What is IQ data?

2. **Live Demo (60 min)**
   - Show FM broadcast reception.
   - Show ADS-B reception and a live aircraft map.
   - If possible, record part of a satellite pass.

3. **Hands-On (30–60 min)**
   - Students try tuning to different signals on the laptop.
   - Explain basic parameters (frequency, gain, sample rate).

4. **Follow-Up**
   - Share GitHub repo link.
   - Encourage students to try experiments at home with cheap SDRs.
