# Experiment Ideas – "Art from Radio"

Besides pure technical experiments, I also want to explore radio as a
source of visuals and "art". Some ideas for later in the project:

## 1. Turning Spectra into Pictures

- Take the power spectrum from different bands (FM, ADS-B, satellites).
- Map power levels to brightness and generate abstract images.
- Compare how different parts of the spectrum "look" as pictures.

## 2. Waterfall Snapshots

- Use the waterfall plots (time vs frequency vs power) as backgrounds
  or textures.
- Capture interesting moments (for example, when a satellite passes)
  and save them as PNG images.
- Maybe print one "radio painting" as a poster.

## 3. Radio "Signatures" of Places

- Record short IQ samples in different locations (city center, quiet
  park, near the airport).
- For each recording, generate a spectrum or waterfall image.
- Compare how the RF environment changes visually between places.

## 4. Sharing with Non-Technical People

- Use these images to explain SDR and HackRF to people who are not very
  technical.
- The idea: "This is what the invisible signals around us look like."

These ideas are not my first priority, but I keep them here as a reminder
that SDR can also be creative and visual, not only mathematical.
