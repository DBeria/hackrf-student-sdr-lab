# Legal and Ethical Notes

This project is intended purely for learning and education.

- I only plan to **receive and analyse** signals that are legal to receive
  in my country (FM broadcast, ADS-B, weather and amateur satellites where
  allowed, etc.).
- I do **not** plan to transmit or replay signals on bands that require a
  license or authorization.
- ADS-B and similar aviation signals will only be **passively received**
  for visualisation and educational purposes.
- The goal of this lab is to help students (including in Georgia) understand
  radio, SDR, and basic signal processing, not to interfere with any real
  systems.

If in doubt, I will always prefer a conservative, receive-only and
education-only approach.
