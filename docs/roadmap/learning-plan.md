# Learning Plan

I am a student and I am using this project to learn SDR step by step.
This is my current roadmap:

## Phase 1 – SDR Basics (without HackRF)

- Understand IQ data, sampling rate, bandwidth, SNR.
- Practice with free online IQ recordings.
- Learn to use GQRX / SDR# to:
  - tune to FM broadcast
  - adjust gain and filters
  - demodulate basic signals.

## Phase 2 – First Signals with HackRF One

- Install drivers and test that HackRF One works.
- Receive local FM broadcast and compare with previous recordings.
- Record my own IQ files and document the workflow.

## Phase 3 – ADS-B

- Set up an antenna and decode ADS-B from aircraft.
- Visualize aircraft positions on a simple map.
- Write a short tutorial so other students can repeat it.

## Phase 4 – Weather Satellites (NOAA / Meteor)

- Study satellite passes and orbital prediction tools.
- Build or buy a simple V-dipole / QFH antenna.
- Record at least one NOAA pass and try to decode an image.
- Document every step, including mistakes and troubleshooting.

## Phase 5 – Sharing & Workshops

- Clean up tutorials and scripts and publish them in this repo.
- Run a small local session for students in my city and use HackRF One
  live to show real signals.
- Collect feedback and update the guides.
